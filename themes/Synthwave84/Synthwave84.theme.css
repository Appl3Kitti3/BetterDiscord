/* This is not a customizable theme. People have reached out about customizing but my intention
is to keep this theme as true to my original vision as possible. 

For those that want a theme that is more customizable, I am currently working on one that will
have a similar feel to Synthwave '84 but will allow you to customize it and put your creative 
touch on it.

Thank you for all of the feedback - it's been helpful in creating a theme that we all can
enjoy! */
