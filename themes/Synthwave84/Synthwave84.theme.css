/* This is not a customizable theme. People have reached out about customizing but my intention
is to keep this theme as true to my original vision as possible. 

For those that want a theme that is more customizable, I am currently working one that will
have a similar feel to Synthwave '84 but will allow you to put your creative touch on it.

Thank you for all of the feedback - it's been helpful in creating a theme that we can all
enjoy! */
